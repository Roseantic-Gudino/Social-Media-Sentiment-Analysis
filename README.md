# Social Media Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the sentiment of Twitter data using a Logistic Regression model to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. It includes interactive visualizations such as sunburst and lollipop charts, and a Streamlit app to allow users to explore sentiment predictions in an easy-to-use interface.

## Features
- Train a Logistic Regression model for sentiment classification.
- Visualize sentiment distribution with Sunburst and Lollipop charts.
- Streamlit app for interactive sentiment analysis.
- Separate training and validation datasets.
- Command-line execution for training and running the app.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
- Plotly / Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualizations)
- Streamlit (Web app framework)

## Dataset
- Two datasets are used:
  - Training dataset
  - Validation dataset  
- Each contains labeled tweets with sentiment tags.

## Installation & Setup

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Punith-Singh/sentiment-analysis.git

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-media-sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment
cd src

##Step 2: Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

##Step 3: Install dependencies

##Step 4: Train the Logistic Regression model

         python train.py ( This command will train your model using the training dataset and save the trained model file )

##Step 5: Run the Streamlit app
         streamlit run app.py ( This launches the interactive web app where you can input tweets, get sentiment predictions, and explore visualizations )
